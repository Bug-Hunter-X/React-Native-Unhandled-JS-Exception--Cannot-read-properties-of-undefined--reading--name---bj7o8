This error occurs when you try to access a property of an object before the object itself is fully initialized or defined.  This commonly happens in asynchronous operations where you expect data to be fetched and processed before you use it.  For instance, imagine fetching data from an API and immediately trying to display it in a component before the fetch is complete.  The component will render before the data arrives, causing the error because the object's properties are still undefined.

```javascript
// Incorrect Code

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(setData);
  }, []);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{data.name}</Text> {/* This line might cause the error */}
    </View>
  );
};
```
